# Audio Transcription using Wav2Vec2

This Python script provides a simple way to transcribe audio files into text using the Wav2Vec2 model from the `transformers` library, along with audio processing from `librosa`.

## Description

The script `transcribe_audio.py` utilizes the Wav2Vec2 model, specifically the "facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h" variant, for automatic speech recognition (ASR). It loads an audio file, processes it, and then uses the model to transcribe the spoken words into text.

## Requirements installation
Create a virtualenv and pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To use the script, place your audio file in an accessible directory. The script currently expects a file named `download.flac` in the `myvoice` folder.

Run the script using:

```bash
python transcribe.py
```

The output will be the transcribed text printed in the console.
